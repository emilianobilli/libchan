 *    n:   The number of operations in the set.
 *
 * Returns:
 *    Nothing.

/*
 * Function: wakeup_next_waiting
 * ----------------------------
 * This function wakes up the next waiting thread that's associated with a specific 'chan_t'. 
 *
 * This function accomplishes its task by dequeuing a condition variable from the queue associated 
 * with the operation type (op_type), which could either be OP_SEND or OP_RECV. It then performs an 
 * atomic compare-and-exchange operation to assign a new value to cv->cd if its current value is 
 * CV_NULL_CHANNEL_DESCRIPTOR. If the operation is successful, the function wakes up the thread associated 
 * with the condition variable and decreases its reference count. 
 *
 * If the compare-and-exchange operation is not successful, the function decreases the reference count 
 * of the condition variable. If its reference count goes to 0, the condition variable is released.
 *
 * Parameters:
 * - chan: A pointer to the 'chan_t' structure associated with the waiting threads.
 * - op_type: The type of operation (OP_SEND or OP_RECV) to perform.
 * - cd: An integer representing the condition variable's descriptor.
